\***\*How activation works:\*\***

(I) User clicks on "Active contract."

(II) User has to input the receiving address (thus, if something happens to the user, the address they did input will receive the funds).

(III) User pays $369 in ETH or in any stablecoin (DAI, GHO, USDC, USDT, etc) to activate the contract.

(IV) A 369-day timer begins.

(V) User is presented with the flow to deposit funds into the contract.

(VI) User can deposit funds in the contract at any time and as many times as they want with no extra charge from u369.

(VII) User can also withdraw at any time with no restrictions and no fees for u369; but only the network fee to validators to confirm the Tx.

(VIII) 36 days and 9 hours before the 369 days elapse, a timer-reminder kicks in for the user to become aware that they have to pay the same amount ($369 in ETH or or stablecoin) to reactivate the contract for 369 more days.

(IX) if the user doesn't pay the $369 when the 369 days come to term >> two more grace periods of 36 days and 9 hours will show (if user fails to pay the $369 fee options at the conceived in first and second 36 days and 9 hours cycles) >> funds are sent to address the user did input to send the funds they deposited.

(X) If the user does pay the $369, the contract reactivates, and the 369-day timer starts over again.
