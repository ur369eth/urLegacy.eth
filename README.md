**\*How activation/subscription works:**

(I) The user connects wallet and clicks on the 'Program' button corresponding to the token they wish to be sent (in the future) to the designated wallet address (heir, entity, AI agent, et cetera).

(II) The user inputs the receiving wallet address (the designated wallet address).

(III) The user enters the beneficiary's name (this is the person or entity that should receive the funds). Inputting a name is optional.

(IV) The user enters the subscription day(s) (i.e., the amount of days the funds will be within the contract).

Note:

- In first instance, to activate the contract/subscription the minimum amount of days the user can select is 1 day and the maximum amount of days is 369 days; however, after the contract is activated, the user can add more days as desired by clicking the "Renew" button and following the flow. The contract is reactivated by paying the corresponding fee for the time subscription. 

- When the subscription days comes to an end, the funds within the contract are sent to the wallet address designated by the user.

- If the user reactivates the contract before the time-subscription ends, then the funds remain within the contract and in under the user's control, thus funds are sent to designated address upon new expiry date entered by the user.

- The contract charges $1.00 from 1 to 10 days; $2 from 10 to 20 days and $3 from 20 to 30 days. After 30 days the contract charges $1 per day; however only up to 227 days the fee is charged... The rest of days selected from 227 days to 369 days are free of charge. Thus, the total amount charged is $200 for the 369 days subscription.

(V) The user enters the amount they wish to be sent to the heir/designated address.

(VI) The user enters their Sign Key (or quantum resistant Sign Key).

(VII) The user selects the token to pay the subscription-fee in order to activate the contract. The fee can be paid with ETH (by default) or with LINK, AAVE, GHO, DAI, USDC, and USDT.

(VIII) The user clicks on 'Activate' button.

(IX) Once the contract is activated, the user can deposit more funds at any time during the active subscription; and the user can withdraw any amount and/or the full amount at any time.

(X) In the 'Subscription' tab it is displayed for the user:

- The subscription ID
- A green 'Active' status which indicates the contract is active/operational.
- The expiry date and time of the contract/subscription.
- The asset being programmed and the amount to be sent in the future.
- The beneficiary's name (if the user opted to input it).
- The designated wallet address where the funds shall be sent to upon contract expiration.
- The options to 'Renew Contract' -- 'Change Designated Address and Beneficiary's Name' -- 'Deposit' more tokens into contract -- 'Withdraw' tokens from contract.
- Note: The Sign Key is always required for the options cited above and before signing a transaction as it helps with preventing theft or any type of exploitation.

(XI) When the susbcription/time ends, an 'Expired' status (in red) shows in the 'Subscription' tab indicating that (A) the contract has sent the funds to the designated wallet address, or (B) the user withdrew to their own wallet, and the duration of the contract came to a term and it was not renewed.
